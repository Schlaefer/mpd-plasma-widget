Manifesto

- Provide an interface for mpd feeling reasonably native to the current KDE plasma desktop. Blend in!
- Flow is important: Fill the queue with minimal friction. In and Out in twenty seconds.
- The experience should be visually driven utilizing artwork/covers.
- Show local covers, not what someone else uploaded to the cloud. Respect the effort the user invested in maintaining their local library. This extends to artists: Don't show faces of strangers.
- Don't provide every feature. Be reasonable about your resources. It's more important to Spark Joy(tm) and polish existing features. Never add new features while exiting are rotting.
