    - Single-Click+Ctrl to select or deselect a single song
- Follow-mode changes:
    - Toggling Follow-mode manually moved to Shift+F

    - Making changes to the Queue disables Follow-mode for a short time
    - Fixes showing the same song with duplicate song in the Queue
- Adds Right-Click menu in Artists for whole artist-row
- Selects last loaded playlist in Queue's Replace Playlist dialog

# 4.0
- Adds removing a playlist

- Adds emptying the queue
- Adds selecting items in the queue (with some advanced options in the context menu)
- Adds removing selected items from the queue
- Fixes issues if song meta information included special characters
- Adds cover cache clearing (currently context-menu on the widget cover). - Use it in case of emergency. But! If someone(tm) stuffed a huge png into a file or the audio-file is very big (long duration) then loading the cover for the first time may take several seconds. Give it time, that's normal. 
- Lots of code refactoring. - Some parts are trickling down into the "Yeah, that looks reasonable" bucket now. But the vast majority still falls out of the "What dis?" QML-cloud. It's a learning experience.
