# 2.1
- Checks if mpc is found before trying to execute commands with it.
- Shows instruction message if mpc isn't found.
- Improves check and reconnect if mpd-server is not found

# 2.0
- Shows generic album-icon if no cover is available
- Selects currently playing item when Queue window is shown
- Uses breeze's generic media-controller icon as widget-symbol-icon
- Adds setting for transparent background in widget configuration
- Improves drop-shadow drawing
- Changes font-size control from pixel to point measure. Adjust the value down if you previously changed it. New default value is 10 (was 13).
- Informs about empty play queue
- Improves cover fetching time
- Lot-o-Codecleanup & minor layout tweaks
- Bumps version to 2.0. Hopefully that will unclog the store.kde.org update issues. Also I would consider this a solid "1.0" if we had started out with 0.x instead of 1.x before.
